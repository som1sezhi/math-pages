</div>

<p>The idea that "some infinities are bigger than other infinities" sounded pretty wild the first time I heard of it. Infinity is a concept, not a number, right? So how can you compare them like numbers and proclaim one infinity as bigger than the other?</p>

<p>Well, from my current understanding, infinity <i>is</i> just a concept, but that doesn't stop <i>transfinite numbers</i> from existing:</p>

<div class="box def">
	<p> <span class="def-num">Definition 1-1: </span>
	A <i>transfinite number</i> is a number greater than any finite number.</p>
</div>

<p>To see how transfinite numbers can come about, let's consider this set $A$:</p>

<div class="img">
	<img src="imgs/1-1_a.png" style="width: 50%;" />
	<p class="caption">beautiful</p>
</div>

<p>This lovely set $A$ here consists of four apples. <i>Four</i> is the number of elements in this set: its <i>cardinality</i>.</p>

<div class="box def">
	<p><span class="def-num">Definition 1-2: </span>
	For a set $S$, its <i>cardinality</i> $|S|$ is the number of elements in $S$.</p>
</div>

<p>In the case of our previous set of apples, $|A|=4$.</p>

<div class="box def">
	<p><span class="def-num">Definition 1-3: </span>
	<i>Cardinal numbers</i> (<i>cardinals</i> for short) are numbers that can be used to measure the cardinality of a set.</p>
</div>

<p>For example, any natural number (0 shall be considered a natural number, as is standard in set theory) can be used as a cardinal number; we can imagine a set quite easily having 0, 2, or a billion elements.</p>

<p>But what's the cardinality of $\mathbb N$, the set of all natural numbers?</p>
<p>$$\mathbb N=\{0,1,2,3,4,\ldots\}$$</p>
<p class="caption">"wow, that's a long 'un"</p>

<p>$\mathbb N$ is an infinite set, so we can't use any of the natural numbers to describe its cardinality. But $\mathbb N$ <i>is</i> a set, so it has a cardinality. Some cardinal number greater than any natural number...</p>

<div class="img">
	<img src="imgs/1-1_aleph0.png" style="max-width:90%;" />
</div>

<p>$\aleph_0$ (aleph-zero, aleph-naught, or aleph-null) is the name we give to the cardinality of $\mathbb N$. Since $\aleph_0$ describes a cardinality, it is, in fact, a cardinal number, although it looks kinda funky compared to the numbers we're used to.</p>

<p>And so we reach our first transfinite number: the first, smallest infinity. But as you may have heard, infinity isn't as simple as just $\aleph_0$. We'll get to the bigger infinities when we get there, but in the meantime, we can categorize sets as follows:</p>

<div class="box def">
	<p><span class="def-num">Definition 1-4: </span>
	A set $S$ is:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><i>countable</i> if $|S|\leq\aleph_0$</li>
		<li><i>countably infinite</i> if $|S|=\aleph_0$</li>
		<li><i>uncountable</i> or <i>uncountably infinite</i> if $|S|\gt\aleph_0$</li>
	</ul>
</div>

<p>A countable set is called "countable" since we can number off all its elements with the natural numbers, i.e. we can <i>count</i> their elements. Even in the cases where the set is countably infinite, you can still count off all its elements, although it'll take literally forever and you'll have to use all the natural numbers along the way.</p>

<p>But for uncountable sets? Note that uncountable sets have a larger cardinality than $\mathbb N$, meaning that even though the natural numbers are infinite, there are literally not enough naturals for you to number off all the elements of an uncountable set. We'll see in a later section how the hell a set can be like that.</p>

<p>Infinite sets are just some of those things in math where you'll need to throw standard intuition out the window to understand it. Still though, trying to wrap your head around one of these things can be quite fun!</p>
